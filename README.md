(incomplete) UI for PySCF

- with streamlit installed, to run locally, run `streamlit run stream.py`
- `test.py` is for testing changes before changing `stream.py`
- put precomputed molecules in the `precomputed_molecules` folder
    - must end with `.geom.txt` and be formatted the same as the other files

### TODO
- add more molecules (with proper names for better search)
- input validation?

Dependencies:
